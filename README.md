I'm currently a ~~software engineer~~microkitchen inspector at Meta, working on WhatsApp. Broadly speaking, I work on developer tooling/infrastructure - things like: source code generation, IDE extensions, linting/static analysis, IDE integrations, cross-repository code syncing, just to name a few.

I'm interested in compilers, programming languages, and data visualization, and I maintain [a blog](https://yangdanny97.github.io) where I talk about some of those things.

If you're a JavaScript developer interested in learning the basics of functional programming through ReScript, check out my book [Introducing ReScript: Functional Programming for Web Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-ReScript-Functional-Programming-Applications/dp/1484288874).

I'm available for part-time consulting/freelancing in the area of data visualization and D3.js - if you're interested in my services, shoot me an email.
