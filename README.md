I'm currently a software engineer at Meta, working on WhatsApp. I'm interested in compilers, programming languages, and data visualization, and I maintain [a blog](https://yangdanny97.github.io) where I talk about some of those things.

Shoot me an email if:
- you have any feedback/comments/questions about any blog posts I wrote
- you want my help/advice on technical subjects or job/internship hunting or interview prep
- you want to pay me to write a script or utility or make an interactive chart for you
