I'm currently a software engineer at Meta, working on WhatsApp. I'm interested in compilers, programming languages, and data visualization, and I maintain [a blog](https://yangdanny97.github.io) where I talk about some of those things.

If you're a JavaScript developer interested in learning the basics of functional programming through ReScript, check out my book [Introducing ReScript: Functional Programming for Web Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-ReScript-Functional-Programming-Applications/dp/1484288874).

I'm available for part-time consulting in the area of data visualization/D3.js - if you're interested in my services, shoot me an email or find me on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0135c6f16760131b2c).
