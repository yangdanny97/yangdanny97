I'm currently a software engineer at Meta, working on WhatsApp. I'm interested in compilers, programming languages, and data visualization, and I maintain [a blog](https://yangdanny97.github.io) where I talk about some of those things.

If you're a JavaScript developer interested in learning the basics of functional programming through ReScript, consider preordering my book [Introducing ReScript: Functional Programming for the Web](https://www.amazon.com/Introducing-ReScript-Functional-Programming-Applications/dp/1484288874).

I'm available for part-time consulting for data-viz-related topics! If you want me to build you a dashboard or chart using D3.js, shoot me an email or find me on [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~0135c6f16760131b2c).
